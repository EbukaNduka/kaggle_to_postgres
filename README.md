# Kaggle Data Fetch and PostgreSQL Population

This script fetches data from a Kaggle endpoint, extracts it from a zip file, and populates a PostgreSQL database with the extracted data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- PostgreSQL server installed and running locally or accessible remotely.
- Necessary Python packages installed (`requests`, `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.

2. Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas sqlalchemy
   ```

3. Ensure PostgreSQL server is running and configure connection parameters (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`) in the script according to your setup.

## Usage

1. Run the script `fetch_and_populate.py` using Python:

   ```bash
   python populate.py
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Fetch the data from the Kaggle endpoint specified (`KAGGLE_ZIP_URL`).
   - Extract the data from the downloaded zip file into memory.
   - Populate a PostgreSQL database named `Email_db` (change as per your database name) with the extracted data assuming it's in CSV format.

## Script Explanation

- **fetch_and_extract_data()**: Fetches the data from `KAGGLE_ZIP_URL`, extracts it into memory from the zip file, and returns it.

- **populate_db(data)**: Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, reads the extracted data (assuming CSV format), and populates a table named `ClientData` (replace with your desired table name) with the data.

## Configuration

- **Database Connection Parameters** (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`): Modify these variables in the script to match your PostgreSQL database connection details.

- **KAGGLE_ZIP_URL**: Replace this variable with the actual Kaggle endpoint URL from where you want to fetch the data.

## Notes

- Ensure the PostgreSQL user (`DB_USER`) has appropriate privileges to create and modify tables in the specified database (`DB_NAME`).

- This script assumes the fetched data is in CSV format. Adjust the `pd.read_csv()` function if your data format is different.

## Error Handling

- The script includes basic error handling to manage exceptions during data fetching, extraction, and database population. Errors will be printed to the console with appropriate messages.
